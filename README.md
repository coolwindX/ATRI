## ABOUT
This project name and inspiration from [ATRI-My Dear Moments-](https://atri-mdm.com/) by [ANIPLEX](https://aniplex-exe.com/).

For Tencent QQ group add a lively ATRI is the goal of this project.

The project leader, learn Python is still less than half a year, so i think the code of this project may increase your blood pressure. But i'll do it better!

This project also serves as a good channel for me to learn Python. Thanks [Richard Chien](https://github.com/richardchien) and the Python-SDK: [NoneBot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot), them provided great help to this project.

## ACHIEVE
アトリ can run on all platforms.

This project is completed by `go-CQHTTP + NoneBot` with `Python` as the main language.

**The framework of the previous version is CoolQ, here to commemorate the suspension of CoolQ**

**May we meet in a more open parallel world**
